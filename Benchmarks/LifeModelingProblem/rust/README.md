How to run rust benchmarks:

1. Install Rust and add to Path
2. Install Rust nightly: `rustup install nightly` (needed to run test features)
3. Compile and run with bench flag: `cargo +nightly bench`

It will show output that looks like this:

```rust
‚ùØ cargo +nightly bench                                                                                                     (base)

running 3 tests
test bench_xor_1000_ints  ... bench:          23 ns/iter (+/- 0)
test bench_xor_1000_ints2 ... bench:          14 ns/iter (+/- 0)
test bench_xor_1000_ints3 ... bench:           7 ns/iter (+/- 0)

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 3 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 9.52s
```
